## Overview

The **Phenotype Prediction** toolkit provides a streamlined approach for predicting human phenotypes using data from the UK Biobank. This toolkit employs tree-based ensembles and linear models to analyze high-dimensional SNP and covariate data. It focuses on variant selection through Random Feature Selection, ensuring a balance between accuracy and runtime efficiency. Additionally, the toolkit allows for interpretation of genetic and socio-demographic feature contributions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilize advanced tree-based ensembles and linear models for accurate phenotype predictions.
- **Data Handling**: Efficiently load and manage high-dimensional SNP and covariate data.
- **Variant Selection**: Implement Random Feature Selection to optimize model performance.
- **Interpretability**: Use SHAP to interpret the contributions of genetic and socio-demographic features.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for ease of use, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners.

## Installation

To install the **Phenotype Prediction** toolkit, clone the repository and install the required packages. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flyflyck/Phenotype_Prediction.git
cd Phenotype_Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. The toolkit relies on several libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and SHAP.

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the toolkit by importing it into your Python script. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the toolkit:

```python
import phenotype_prediction as pp

# Load your SNP and covariate data
data = pp.load_data('your_data_file.csv')

# Select features
selected_features = pp.random_feature_selection(data)

# Train model
model = pp.train_model(selected_features)

# Make predictions
predictions = pp.predict(model, new_data)
```

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Data Requirements

The toolkit requires high-dimensional SNP data and covariate data. The data should be formatted in CSV files, where:

- Each row represents an individual.
- Columns include SNPs and socio-demographic features.
- Ensure that missing values are handled before loading the data.

### Example Data Format

| ID   | SNP1 | SNP2 | Age | Gender |
|------|------|------|-----|--------|
| 1    | 0    | 1    | 30  | Male   |
| 2    | 1    | 0    | 25  | Female |
| ...  | ...  | ...  | ... | ...    |

## Modeling Techniques

The **Phenotype Prediction** toolkit employs several modeling techniques:

### Tree-Based Ensembles

Tree-based models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, provide robust predictions by combining multiple decision trees. They are particularly effective for high-dimensional data and can capture complex interactions between features.

### Linear Models

Linear models, such as Logistic Regression, offer simplicity and interpretability. They are useful for understanding the relationship between features and outcomes, especially when the relationships are expected to be linear.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

The toolkit includes options for hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. Use techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters for your models.

## Interpreting Results

Interpreting model results is crucial for understanding the underlying biology. The toolkit integrates SHAP for feature importance analysis. SHAP values provide insights into how each feature contributes to the model's predictions.

### Example SHAP Analysis

```python
import shap

# Explain the model's predictions using SHAP
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(new_data)

# Visualize the SHAP values
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, new_data)
```
